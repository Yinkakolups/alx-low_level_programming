#C - Debugging

#TASKS.

1. Multiple mains mandatory in most projects,you are often given only one main file to test with . For example, this main file is a test for a positive_or_negative() function similar to the previous C project we have worked on

2. Copy this main file. Comment out (don't delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
Dont add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line counts. You are only allowed to comment out existing code. You do not have to compile with -wall-werror-wextra-pedantic for this task.

3. Leap year mandatory. This program convert a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in a year, taking leap year into consideration.
